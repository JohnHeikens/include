 * Permutation table. This is just a random jumble of all numbers 0-255.

 *

 * This produce a repeatable pattern of 256, but Ken Perlin stated

 * that it is not a problem for graphic texture as the noise features disappear

 * at a distance far enough to be able to see a repeatable pattern of 256.

 *

 * This needs to be exactly the same for all instances on all platforms,

 * so it's easiest to just keep it as static explicit data.

 * This also removes the need for any initialisation of this class.

 *

 * Note that making this an uint32_t[] instead of a uint8_t[] might make the

 * code run faster on platforms with a high penalty for unaligned single

 * byte addressing. Intel x86 is generally single-byte-friendly, but

 * some other CPUs are faster with 4-aligned reads.

 * However, a char[] is smaller, which avoids cache trashing, and that

 * is probably the most important aspect on most architectures.

 * This array is accessed a *lot* by the noise functions.

 * A vector-valued noise over 3D accesses it 96 times, and a

 * fp-valued 4D noise 64 times. We want this to fit in the cache!
